I am a curious and ambitious junior full stack developer with a passion for fintech and healthcare, looking for a role where I can use and extend my programming knowledge while also gaining exposure to product management and wider business strategy.

After graduating from Western University in Canada with a degree in Psychology, I spent two years working in account management in a digital marketing agency. I started teaching myself how to code when I had the opportunity to automate some of the more repetitive parts of my role, and I am now training full time at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. What excites me about coding, and technology in general, is that well made software allows people to spend more time doing what they love by reducing time spent on tasks that are more mundane.

**Tech Skills:** 
- Languages: Ruby, JavaScript
- Development Frameworks: Rails
- Testing frameworks: RSpec (Ruby), Jasmine (JavaScript), Capybara and Selenium-Webdriver (feature testing web-apps)
- Other: TravisCI (continuous integration), CodeClimate (accountability and test coverage), Heroku (cloud-based hosting)

## Skills

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a 90-page dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders among my clients. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room.

#### Analytics

I am always analysing and looking for ways to improve, and demonstrate this both in my work and in my own processes. In my last job, I regularly consumed large data sets and extracted meaningful and actionable insights for my client's businesses. About a year into the job, I also analysed my time sheets and found that I was spending a lot of time on a repetitive task, so I wrote code to automate it; code which is now used across the agency. 

#### Passion

When I find something I am passionate about, I tend to adopt a laser focus. For instance, I found that many people in the agency I worked at were complaining about their jobs, but we didn't have a mechanism for anonymously feeding back to management. In my free time, I spoke to many people across the business, did research about different options, and eventually found Peakon (an employee engagement platform). I successfully pitched a case to the leadership team and secured funding from our finance department. We on-boarded the platform and began to improve employee satisfaction and engagement.

#### Additional skills

 - Methodologies: Agile, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development
 - Languages: Basic Spanish
