I am a curious and ambitious junior **full stack developer** with a passion for fintech and automation, looking for a role where I can use and extend my programming knowledge while also gaining exposure to product management and wider business strategy.

After graduating from Western University in Canada with a degree in Psychology, I spent two years working in account management in a digital marketing agency. I started teaching myself how to code when I had the opportunity to automate some of the more repetitive parts of my role, and I am now training full time at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. What excites me about coding, and technology in general, is that software can free up time for people to be more creative by reducing time spent on tasks that are more mundane.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, **insert list of other tech skills here**

## Skills

#### Communicative

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a 90-page dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills in my last job, where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders among my clients. This saw me gain abilities in synthesising complex technical information into digestible stories for the different levels of interest in the room.

#### Analytical

I am always analysing and looking for ways to improve, and demonstrate this both in my work but also in my own processes. In my last job, I regularly consumed large data sets and extracted meaningful and actionable insights for my clients businesses. About a year into the job, I also analysed my time sheets and found that I was spending a lot of time on a repetitive task, so I wrote code to automate it, and it's now used across the agency. 

#### Passionate

When I find something I am passionate about, I tend to adopt a laser focus. I found in my last job that many people were complaining about work at the pub, but we didn't have a mechanism for anonymously feeding back to management. I spoke to many people across the business, did a lot of research about different options, and eventually found Peakon (an employee engagement platform). I successfully pitched a case to the leadership team and secured funding from our finance department. We on-boarded the platform and began to improve employee satisfaction and engagement.

 - Methodologies : Agile, Test Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development
 - Languages : Basic Spanish
