I am a curious and ambitious full stack developer looking for a full-time role in London. 

After graduating from Western University in Canada with a degree in Psychology, I spent two years working in account management in a digital marketing agency. I started teaching myself how to code when I had the opportunity to automate some of the more repetitive parts of my role, and I've just finished training full time at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. You can find out more about my career-changing journey in my blog post about it, [here](https://blog.makersacademy.com/bad-days-learning-to-code-and-gaining-control-422936255bb7). 

What excites me about software is that it can bring innovation to any industry it's applied to. It has the power to reduce friction in difficult processes, connect disparate information sources, and automate away mundane or repetitive tasks. In general, I believe in its power to be a positive agent of change for the world.

## Skills

#### Communication

I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic. 

#### Analysis

I am always analysing and looking for ways to improve. In my last job, I regularly digested large data sets and extracted meaningful and actionable insights for my client's businesses. About a year into the job, I also analysed my time sheets and found that I was spending a lot of time on a repetitive task, so I wrote code to automate it; code which is now used across the agency. At Makers, this looked like regularly analysing my growth to keep myself accountable. I did this by attending process workshops to hone my TDD and debugging skills, and by checking my knowledge with coaches.

#### Stewardship

When I agree to partake in something, I care about how it goes, and I try to leave things better than I found them. For instance, I found that many people in the agency I used to work at were complaining about their jobs, but we didn't have a mechanism for anonymously feeding back to management. In my free time, I spoke to many people across the business, did research about different options, and eventually found a suitable employee engagement platform. I successfully pitched a case to the leadership team and secured funding from our finance department. We on-boarded the platform and began to improve employee satisfaction and engagement.

 - Languages: Basic Spanish
 - Storytelling: See my [blog](https://medium.com/@jlblumberg) for examples
