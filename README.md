## Josh Blumberg

I am a curious and ambitious junior **full stack developer** with a passion for fintech and automation, looking for a role where I can use and extend my programming knowledge while also gaining exposure to product management and wider business strategy.

After graduating from Western University in Canada with a degree in Psychology, I spent two years working in account management in a digital marketing agency. I started teaching myself how to code when I had the opportunity to automate some of the more repetitive parts of my role, and I am now training full time at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp. What excites me about coding, and technology in general, is that software can free up time for people to be more creative by reducing time spent on tasks that are more mundane.

**Tech Skills:** Ruby, Rails, **insert list of other tech skills here**
